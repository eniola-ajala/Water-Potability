# Water Potability
### Water is the most significant resource of life, crucial for supporting the life of most existing creatures and human beings. Living organisms need water with enough quality to continue their lives. There are certain limits of pollutions that water species can tolerate. Exceeding these limits affects the existence of these creatures and threatens their lives.
As per the United Nations (UN) report, about 1.5 million people die each year because of contaminated water-driven diseases. In developing countries, it is announced that 80% of health problems are caused by contaminated water. Five million deaths and 2.5 billion illnesses are reported annually. Such a mortality rate is higher than deaths resulting from accidents, crimes, and terrorist attacks.
